            <h1 style="font-family: fantasy;">Genetic Modification for Human Beings Should Not Be Allowed</h1>


            <h3>Mr. Simon Zerisenay Ghebremeskel</h3>

            <p>
                Genetic modification is one of the outcomes of the disruptive biotechnological developments that our
                world acquired through the study called genetic engineering in the recent few decades. Genetic
                modification can be defined as a technique to change the characteristics of organisms especially,
                animals and plants by making changes in their genetic makeup (Ross, 2019). It has been a long time since
                Genetic modification started to be implemented on plant seeds successfully. Moreover, it has been an
                important tool for enhancing world agriculture as it is used to treat plant seeds and improve their
                qualitative and quantitative productivity. After Scientists saw the importance of genetic modification
                or gene editing in plants and other micro-organisms, they came up with an idea that is to implement it
                on human beings. Firstly, the idea was to use genetic modification to cure genetic disorders. As a
                result of extensive studies and researches made by scientists, in 2012, the CRISPR cas9 technology was
                found. The CRISPR cas9 is a powerful biotechnological tool used to design embryos in their early stage
                (Vidyasagar, 2018). Moreover, it is said to be a supportive tool as it helps the doctors and genetic
                engineers, who are using the tool, to easily spot and have full control to tune the different parts of
                the gene selectively. But the world hasn’t stand fully with the scientists who were trying to introduce
                CRISPR technology. According to Human Genetic Modification(n.d.), More than forty countries have either
                discouraged or outright banned this methodology. There are several reasons that initiated almost all the
                powerful countries to ban and to stand opposite to the development of the biotechnological tool, which
                is CRISPR cas9, used in genetic modification of human embryos in early stages. But, nowadays some of the
                technologically advanced countries including the United Kingdom and China licensed genetic modification
                in human embryos. This made a big shock for other counties who are in a continued effort to disrupt the
                development of this technology, as allowing it will fully affect biodiversity and result in social
                problems. Thus, Governments, Organizations, and Scientists should work hand in hand to ban Genetic
                modification for human beings as it has several negative aspects including Ethical issues, Risks and
                Ineffectiveness, and Social problems.
            </p>
            <h5> Ethical Issues </h5>
            <p>
           
            The first reason that genetic modification for humans should not be allowed is the ethical concerns it
            raises including violating the rights of next-generation and interfering in the law of nature. Designing
            Embryos which is one of the applications of genetic modification is considered as unethical practice as it
            violates the right of the next generation without consenting them to have their body altered (Collins as
            cited in Harris, 2018). Without your babies having any say altering their mental emotional and physical
            makeup is unethical practice (Minchin, 2019). If this procedure is allowed the babies will have their own
            body designed in a way that their families want them to be and this raises a big ethical issue as parents
            are determining the future of their children without their consent. By doing so parents are interfering in
            law nature as well, as they are not giving this job to nature to create us differently. Harris (2018)
            demonstrates that the new type of biotechnological tools that are introduced to the health care system can
            aptly be described as a comprehensive attempt to frustrate the course of nature. Nature creates us
            differently and that is the reason for the cohesion, beauty, harmony, and interdependence among us. But
            promoting such kinds of biotechnological tools for designing human beings can change the rule of nature,
            undermine the meaning of life and interdependency as well as the unity that our world currently has. Thus,
            genetic modification for humans shouldn’t be taken normally due to the above listed ethical consequences.
            </p>

            <h5> Social Problems</h5>
            <p> One reason that genetic modification for human beings shouldn’t be allowed is that the social problems
                it causes. Genetic modification can fade the beauty of our diversity. Indeed, everyone will look
                relatively similar as most people will seek good looking, intelligent, athletic with other additional
                optimum characteristics, if embryonic modification, which is part of genetic modification is allowed
                (Minchin, 2019). If genetic modification for human beings is allowed, especially for the practice of
                designer babies in cheap price, every parent will try to make the best combination that are possible in
                the market for their children. This can increase the similarities between individuals and fade our
                beautiful diversity. Murmson (2019) claims “Genetic engineering poses a risk to our concept of
                individuality, as individuality is based on some degree of biological difference.” Our diversity is the
                reason that makes us beautiful and plays an important role in unifying us peacefully. But if people are
                similar and with all these upgraded characters, everybody will be able to do everything. Thus, it will
                undermine the dependency between people, and this can make life boring. Moreover, if such kind of
                biotechnological tool is allowed to be used by humans, a marked gap will be created between societies,
                and humanity will be undermined. A designer baby, which is the most interesting concern in the study of
                genetic modification nowadays, can create classes between societies as it is expensive such that only
                rich people can afford the price. The rising technologies are disruptive in the sense they will
                undermine the existing social relationships; besides they can fully change the way of life that the
                people are living (Qiu, 2016). Moreover, they can result in unimaginable power and opportunities and
                lead to new paradigm shifts (Qiu, 2016). CRISPR technology in humans is explicitly done through the
                medical procedure known as in vitro fertilization, whereas IVP is an expensive procedure, thus the rich
                can ensure the biological superiority of their children where are the poor remain inferior as they
                cannot afford the price (Reddy, 2019). Poor people will be sidelined and no more be treated in the same
                way with the rich ones. Thus, the world will resemble what it used to look like before three or four
                decades ago, as this practice can create a marked difference between classes like the division of people
                into different classes into slaves, intermediate and top level.
            </p>
            <h5>Risk and Ineffectiveness</h5>
            <p>
         
            The risks related to the practice and its ineffectiveness is another reason why genetic modification
            shouldn’t be promoted. Currently, the tools used to modify human embryos and cure genetic disorders
            including IVP and the latest one which is CRISPR cas9 are not effective that they can accidentally alter
            off-target chromosomes, causing adverse or even fatal side effects (Shwartz, Holley, & Archibald, n.d.). The
            CRISPR cas9 mentioned above uses the enzyme named cas9 to exactly detect the target section of DNA that is
            infected. Then, the molecular scissors following the instructions alter or edit the genome by cutting or
            adding codons in the correct position. Most of the time the cas9 enzyme wrongly alters another DNA portion
            as the size of genes is extremely small and not evenly spaced, this makes it difficult to find them exactly.
            Even if the cas9 enzyme finds the target DNA, the molecular scissors can use wrong instruction, for
            instance, they can cut a piece of codon and this is a big problem as it fully changes the whole nucleotide
            series of the DNA. Besides, this can cause different types of genetic diseases or can immediately lead to
            death. As, even the latest technology that is recently discovered CRISPR cas9 is not an efficient tool to
            use, designing embryos and treating genetic disorders which are the different ways of genetic modification
            should be banned. In addition to the side effects, genetic modification can result in unintended mutation
            and even in evolution, which is the creation of new species. According to Baird (2007), Making changes to
            the human genetic structure using different technologies can have accidental and unpredictable consequences
            that can create damage to the gene pool. As the gene is an extremely sophisticated and small part of the
            human body that determines all the characteristics and behaviors of a person, it is difficult to predict the
            consequences that can come as a result of alternation of a single part of the genome in any time. The worst
            thing about genetic disorders is that they are inheritable, so if any change is made in the gene pool of a
            person it will affect the coming generation. These biotechnological tools that are used in gene editing are
            so effective that even an accidental release can result in the creation of entirely new species and even
            often in a short period (Kahn, 2016). This can initiate evolution and split human beings into different
            kinds of species. Thus, a genetic modification for human beings shouldn’t be promoted as it is a risky and
            ineffective approach.
            </p>


            <h5>Genetic Modification can Cure Genetic Disorders</h5>
            <p> Admittedly, some people believe that the biotechnological tools of Genetic modification are good weapons
                for human beings to deal with genetic disorders and enhancing immunity. Zhai and Qui (2016) highlights
                that using genome editing is reasonable, as it can treat millions and millions of patients who suffer
                from genetic diseases. One of the interesting reasons that people, who agree with allowing genetic
                modification in humans, use is that individuals will not face any kind of diseases including HIV, Cancer
                and other communicable diseases if they are born with enhanced immunity through the help of the
                biotechnological tools which is commonly the CRISPR cas9. Studies by Chief (2019) highlight, if people
                are born genetically modified with enhanced immunity it can increase the life span of human beings.
                Besides, many people applaud that using such kind of tools can help parents select the gender of their
                babies before their birth.
            </p>



            <p> This argument doesn’t take into consideration the many negative consequences of allowing genetic
                modification. Firstly, the tools that are used for editing genomes aren’t effective that they can cause
                off-target gene alternation which can then result in adverse or even fatal genetic side effects. As
                genes are extremely tiny and sophisticated part that contain billions of characters which determines a
                person, specialists who are responsible for designing embryos cannot predict the consequences of making
                alternations in single DNA nucleotide. For instance, one of the negative consequences of off-target
                effects, which are the result of gene editing, can disable a tumor suppressor gene or activate
                cancer-causing one (Begley, 2016). Moreover, it might cause pieces of two different chromosomes to
                combine, to result in a phenomenon called translocation, which is the main cause of the disorder called
                chronic myeloid leukemia (Begley, 2016). Thus, the biotechnological tools used in designing embryos
                should not be allowed to be used by people due to their inefficiency that could bring mortal side
                effects that couldn’t last even for generations. </p>

                Many people feel that it is good to restrict the use of genetic modification only for treating genetic
                disorders; however, Prudent thinkers would realize that if genetic modification happens all the time to
                cure genetic disorders people will then start to use it in enhancement purposes, and this can change the
                motive from treatment to customer attraction. Allowing human genetic editing for any reason including
                for the treatment of genetic disorders would likely lead to violation of the regulatory limits, adoption
                for enhancement purposes as well as to the efflux of market-based Eugenics that would heighten the
                exiting inequality, conflict, and discrimination(Collins as cited in Darnovsky, 2018). Moreover, Dr.
                Knoepfler (2017) highlights, Permitting the creation of genetically modified humans with the noble goal
                of trying to prevent a rare kind of genetic disease can push us further towards acceptance of designer
                babies. Thus, genetic modification shouldn’t be allowed at all for any kind of reasons as the
                consequences are infinite.
            </p>

            <h5> Conclusion</h5>
            <p>In conclusion, genetic modification has been one of the biggest findings that the field biology has
                acquired in a recent couple of decades. The study of genetic modification has improved the world
                agriculture in different patterns. However, it failed to further operate in human beings due to a number
                of principal reasons. Genetic modification, which is the result of the disruptive biotechnological
                advances, should be disrupted from further improving by the responsible action takers which are
                Governments, organizations, and Scientists. As it can bring a different type of genetic side effects,
                social problems, and ethical concerns. Some people might argue that genetic modification should be
                allowed for treating genetic disorders and enhancing immunity. However, they didn’t consider the
                negative consequences because, if genetic editing for humans is allowed, it can escape the regulatory
                limits and lead to the emergence of market-based eugenics that will furtherly initiate already existing
                conflict, discrimination, and inequality. Thus, genetic modification should not be allowed for any
                reason, as changing the nature of what it means humans has a lot of consequences.
