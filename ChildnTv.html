            <h1 style="font-family: fantasy;">Children and Tv</h1>


            <h3>Anne Marie</h3>

            <p>
                Over the course of the twentieth century, television has come to play a greater role in our daily lives.
                The
                variety of programs and channels on offer have increased dramatically while programming for children in
                particular has undergone considerable growth. Relatively recent reports indicate that children in the US
                between the ages of two and five watch over thirty hours of television per week on average (McDonough,
                2009)
                and average viewing figures for children over two in the UK would seem to be roughly equal (Barkham,
                2009).
                Perhaps more worryingly, in the US, children under two spend 1.2 hours a day watching TV.
                In recent years, a number of organizations and national governments have examined this issue and
                expressed
                their concerns on the matter. More specifically, the French government has banned TV aimed at children
                under
                three (Haeri & Kelly, 2012) while the Australian government has issued guidelines which advise against
                exposure to television for children under two (Barkham, 2009). Michelle Obama, the American first lady,
                has
                recently joined the debate, recommending that children under two should not be allowed to watch any
                television and that parents should carefully limit the amount of viewing done by the over-twos (Haeri &
                Kelly, 2012). Indeed, it seems that children’s television viewing time should be both reduced and
                carefully
                monitored, or even eliminated completely in the case of children under two because of the adverse
                effects it
                has on children’s behavior, educational development and health.
            </p>
            <h5>TV, young children and aggression</h5>
            <p>
            
            Rowell Huesmann et al. (2003) point out that violent television programs are popular with both children and
            adults because they are more exciting and engaging. They go on to cite research showing that violent TV
            shows are both cheaper to produce and easier to sell to foreign television networks (Rowell Huesmann et al.,
            2003). However, this violence can have a lasting negative effect on young children.
            As Eastman (2004) points out, children tend to copy behaviors that they see either in real life or on
            television. If they are exposed to examples of violent behavior as part of their television viewing, and
            particularly, if this violence is not seen to be punished, they are likely to copy this in later life
            (Eastman, 2004). He further explains that programs that show violence as humorous, for example cartoons, can
            make the problem bigger because it can make violence appear as fun. Bushman and Rowell Huesmann (2006) also
            point out that children who are repeatedly exposed to violent television programming, particularly where
            this violence is carried out by their TV heroes or role models, are likely to see this as normal and to
            become more aggressive as adults.
            </p>


            <p> When young children are regularly exposed to more extreme violence, contained, for example, in news
                programs
                or adult films, they become desensitized and start to see this as normal or natural (Eastman, 2004). The
                danger here is not just whether they will become violent but even more importantly whether they will
                tolerate violence unquestionably. As Murray (2005) argues, children may become more willing to tolerate
                violence in their environment and society in later life without protesting or attempting to change the
                situation. Clearly then TV violence can have a serious effect on children’s behavior .
                There are various ways in which we can reduce or eliminate the possible negative effects of television
                violence on young children without completely eliminating television from their lives. One important
                step is
                to limit the amount of television that young pre-school children are allowed to watch, perhaps switching
                on
                the TV set for selected programs only (Eastman, 2004). Another way to mitigate the effects of violence
                is
                for parents to watch along with their offspring (Eastman, 2004). These solutions not only allow adults
                to
                monitor the levels of violence to which children are exposed, but also provide the opportunity to
                educate
                children about the unreal nature of television and the concept of acting.
            </p>
            <h5>Is TV dumbing down our young?</h5>
            <p>
           
            With regard to educational development, children’s viewing habits seem to have a negative effect on language
            development especially for very young children. For instance, Anderson and Pempeck (2005) point to a number
            of studies which seem to indicate that children under two years of age who watch a lot of television have
            slower language development and learn fewer words. Surprisingly, this is true even where under-twos have
            been viewing programs designed to promote language development, such as Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer
            (Anderson and Pempeck, 2005). It may be that these programs are simply too advanced for very young children
            to benefit from. Another reason could be that in their first two years of life, children are only capable of
            learning from face-to-face interaction with adults (Barkham, 2009). Once again, this shows a need for
            television time to be reduced especially for these age groups, or at least for parents to be present and
            interact with their children in order to eliminate the adverse effects of television.
            </p>


            <h5>The role of TV in the obesity epidemic</h5>
            <p>  There would seem to be a clear link between increased time watching television and obesity in children
                (Dietz and Gortmaker, 1985; Swinburn and Shelly, 2008). This link may be due to three factors. First of all,
                increased television viewing can lead to increased food intake due to snacking. Interestingly, some studies
                have found that other activities involving electronic screens, such as internet surfing and video games, are
                not associated with obesity (Swinburn and Shelly, 2008), perhaps because these activities engage the hands
                in a way that television does not, making snacking less likely. Secondly, advertisements shown during
                children’s programs make the issue of snacking worse. As Dietz and Gortmaker (1984) explain, TV programs
                often promote food products, most of the time unhealthy food, and the programs themselves often include
                mentions of food. This may well encourage children to snack more while they watch. Finally, another related
                problem is the lack of physical activity due to watching television. Indeed, as children spend longer and
                longer watching television, they have less time to take part in play or sports activities which might allow
                them to burn off calories (Dietz and Gortmaker, 1985).
            </p>
           

            <h5>TV – helping the young to a more positive view of the world?</h5>
            <p> It is often argued that TV can have a positive effect on how young people see the world around them. Moeller
                (1996) discusses research which seems to indicate that television can affect our beliefs, attitudes and
                values. In her words, “television cultivates a common outlook or world view among its viewers” (p.4). As a
                result of seeing certain events on television, either positive or negative, people, both young and old, may
                tend to believe that these events are more “normal” (p.3). A further interesting theory is that certain
                high-quality television programs can have a far greater effect on attitudes and beliefs, possibly undoing
                some of the damage done by other programs. An example would be The Cosby Show, which shows a family of
                middle-class, sophisticated African Americans going about their daily lives and may counteract the negative
                images of black Americans which are shown in other television programs (Moeller, 1996).This view appears
                convincing at first. However, it should be pointed out that this depends very much on the
                type of program children are watching. As mentioned above, programs with violent content may be both more
                popular with children and cheaper to produce (Rowell Huesmann et al., 2003) which explains to some extent
                why they are increasingly common on television. This means that the high-quality programs are not the rule
                but the exception and, as a result, children are usually exposed to programs that can affect their behavior
                negatively. Overall, there seems to be a need for adult supervision of what children watch if they are to be
                exposed to the type of content which will bring about beneficial effects.</p>
                <h5>TV linked to better language and literacy?</h5>
            <p>
           
            Many people are of the opinion that TV can have a positive effect on children’s literacy and language
            development. Indeed, a number of studies show that when children over the age of two watch well-designed
            educational shows such as Sesame Street, there is a positive effect on their language development (Anderson
            and Pempeck, 2005).
            This argument fails to consider the fact that the majority of TV programs are not designed with language
            development in mind. For this reason, adults should monitor to make sure that children over two watch
            programs that improve their language and avoid less appropriate content. Moreover, the presence of an adult,
            even when the program is educational and potentially beneficial, can increase its effect. For instance,
            Moeller (1996) points to a number of studies which show that adult co-viewers can have a considerable effect
            on how much children learn from educational programs. She indicates that the interaction between an adult
            and a child while watching educational television may be the most important factor in promoting development.
            It would seem, then, that the presence and active participation of an adult or carer is key if television
            viewing is to have a positive influence on children.

            <h5> Conclusion</h5>
            <p>To sum up, television has become an increasingly pervasive presence in our lives. Not only has choice
                expanded dramatically for the adult viewer, but also for young children, whose extended periods of time
                spent in front of the screen is causing considerable concern. This essay has argued that there is an
                urgent
                need for this viewing time to be radically reduced and for parents to be aware what their children are
                watching. It has been further argued that TV viewing should be eliminated altogether for children under
                two
                years of age. Although some might claim that there are behavioral, educational and attitudinal benefits
                which television might offer, it is clear that unrestricted viewing can have a negative effect. Indeed,
                as
                previously discussed, over-exposure to television may well have seriously detrimental effects on the
                behavior, educational achievement and health of children. All evidence would indicate that television is
                here to stay. While it is clear that further research is required to fully assess its potentially
                harmful
                impact on the very young, there would already appear to be considerable evidence that parents, educators
                and
                possibly national governments need to closely examine the way our children use television if the
                negative
                effects are to be eliminated.</p>
