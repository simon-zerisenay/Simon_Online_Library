Purpose
This website (online library) like other traditional libraries is created to provide organized
information resources to people from all over the world in a digital way. This library is more of
academic library, but this doesn’t mean that it doesn’t provide public contents. The purpose of
the library is to provide information in different fields in a digital way. We believe that this
online library will have a significant contribution in the research word.
